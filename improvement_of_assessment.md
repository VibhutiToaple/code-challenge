1 — State management: make it predictable, testable, and performant
Problems in current approach
useState in usePanels is fine, but panel updates (move/resize) are frequent and cause whole-list re-renders.
Panels emit deltas continuously — parent updates state continuously → re-renders each move.
No separation of transient (while dragging) vs canonical state (committed).
Goals
Single authoritative source of truth for panel metadata (id, x, y, w, h, zIndex, open).
Minimize renders during drag by keeping ephemeral data outside React renders until commit.
Make updates atomic and undo/redo-friendly.
Easier tests and time-travel debugging.
Option A — useReducer inside usePanels (recommended)
Implement usePanelsReducer so state changes are explicit, actions are serializable, and you can plug in middleware (persistence, undo/redo).
Example action types + reducer (snippet):
// src/hooks/usePanelsReducer.ts
type Panel = OpenPanel; // from your types
type PanelsAction =
| { type: "OPEN"; payload: { key: string; x:number;y:number;w:number;h:number } }
| { type: "CLOSE"; payload: { id: string } }
| { type: "MOVE"; payload: { id: string; dx: number; dy: number } }
| { type: "SET_POS"; payload: { id: string; x: number; y: number } } // commit final
| { type: "RESIZE"; payload: { id: string; dw: number; dh: number } }
| { type: "SET_SIZE"; payload: { id: string; width: number; height: number } }
| { type: "BRING_TO_FRONT"; payload: { id: string } };

function panelsReducer(state: Panel[], action: PanelsAction) {
switch(action.type) {
case "OPEN": return [...state, createPanelFromPayload(action.payload)];
case "CLOSE": return state.filter(p => p.id !== action.payload.id);
case "MOVE": return state.map(p => p.id === action.payload.id ? { ...p, x: p.x + action.payload.dx, y: p.y + action.payload.dy } : p);
case "SET_POS": return state.map(p => p.id === action.payload.id ? { ...p, x: action.payload.x, y: action.payload.y } : p);
// ...
}
}
How to use: Parent dispatches MOVE for coarse movements, but panels should locally apply transform for fluid motion (see below) and SET_POS only at pointerup.
Option B — Small global store (e.g., Zustand)
If panels are used across many components and you want a tiny store without context provider boilerplate, Zustand is nice:
// src/stores/panelsStore.ts
import create from "zustand";

type PanelsState = { panels: Panel[], openPanel: (...) => void, movePanel: (...) => void, setPanelPos: (...) => void }

export const usePanelsStore = create<PanelsState>((set) => ({
panels: [],
openPanel: (p) => set(state => ({ panels: [...state.panels, p] })),
movePanel: (id, dx, dy) => set(state => ({ panels: state.panels.map(...)})),
// ...
}));
Why use a store? fewer prop drills, easy to subscribe to small slices (less re-render).

2 — Drag & Resize: make interactions smooth (the core UX win)
Problems today
Updates to x,y are applied via React state on every pointermove (causes many re-renders).
Using left/top with layout thrash (reflows) rather than transform.
Pointer capture implementation is okay but can be improved for consistent behavior across browsers.
Principles to apply
Local ephemeral transform: While dragging, update DOM with transform: translate3d(...) using refs + requestAnimationFrame. Do not update React state on each frame.
Commit on pointerup: On pointerup, write final x,y to React state (reconcile).
Use hardware acceleration: CSS transform: translate3d(...) and will-change: transform.
Batch DOM reads/writes: Read layout once, then write transforms inside RAF.
Throttle or use RAF: Use RAF instead of raw pointermove to avoid flooding.
Concrete implementation pattern (in ResizableDraggablePanel)
Store committed coordinates in React state (from store/reducer).
During dragging:
Keep startClient & startCommitted in refs.
On each pointermove, compute dx,dy, set ephemeral ref pendingTransform = {tx,ty}, and schedule RAF to apply panelEl.style.transform = translate3d(tx,ty,0).
Do not set React state each move.
On pointerup, compute final {x: startCommitted.x + tx, y: ...} and dispatch SET_POS to store.
Snippet:
// inside ResizableDraggablePanel component
const elRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement|null>(null);
const pendingRef = useRef({ tx: 0, ty: 0 });
const rafRef = useRef<number | null>(null);

function onPointerMove(e: PointerEvent) {
const dx = e.clientX - startClient.x;
const dy = e.clientY - startClient.y;
pendingRef.current = { tx: dx, ty: dy };
if (!rafRef.current) rafRef.current = requestAnimationFrame(() => {
const el = elRef.current; if (el) el.style.transform = `translate3d(${pendingRef.current.tx}px, ${pendingRef.current.ty}px, 0)`;
rafRef.current = null;
});
}

function onPointerUp() {
cancel any raf; compute finalX = startCommitted.x + pendingRef.current.tx; dispatch({type:"SET_POS", payload:{id, x:finalX, y:finalY}});
// clear transforms (or set left/top to final pos and remove transform)
}
Benefits: visually perfect dragging, React re-render only once at commit.
Resize: same approach
Use ephemeral scaling on content width/height via CSS width/height inline with RAF.
On pointerup commit final width/height to state.

3 — Reusable functionality & extraction
Extract the following into reusable hooks / utilities:
Hooks
useDragMove — encapsulates pointer handlers + RAF + stopPropagation + commit callback. Returns handlers to attach to header.
useResizeHandle — pointer down/up logic for bottom-right resize handle.
useWorkspaceGrid (already done) — keep it pure, move DOM measurements out as a small utility.
useZIndexManager — helper to manage stacking order (bring-to-front on focus).
usePersistState — wrapper to persist panels to localStorage (throttled).
Utilities
dom helpers: getBounds, clientToLocal (pointer relative to container), applyTransform.
math helpers: snapToGrid(x, gridSize) and collision detection helpers.
Example: useDragMove contract
function useDragMove({ id, startX, startY, onCommit }) {
const bind = {
onPointerDown: (e) => { /* init */ },
onPointerMove: (e) => { /* ephemeral */ },
onPointerUp: (e) => { /* commit */ },
};
return bind;
}

4 — Reduce re-renders: selective subscriptions & memoization
Use React.memo for ResizableDraggablePanel and GridDropOverlay.
In parent, render openPanels.map(panel => <Panel key=... panel={panel} />) where Panel receives small panel object. But still a map will re-run — prefer stable identity: if using store (Zustand) subscribe to only the panel slice.
Use stable callbacks: useCallback for handlers passed into many children (onMove etc).
Avoid recreating inline style objects each render (or memoize them).

5 — UX features that improve perceived smoothness & interactivity
Immediate wins
Snap-to-grid while dragging: show snap preview and animate to snap point on release.
Magnetic guides: highlight when edges align with another panel or grid line.
Ghost preview when dragging from nav: show translucent preview sized to the target cell.
Smooth release animation: animate final commit with CSS transition when snapping or snapping back.
Add micro-interactions
Resize cursor and ghost: show a subtle overlay while resizing.
Focus/active states: gentle shadow and scale for focused panel.
Z-index management: bring-to-front on click; animate z changes.
Keyboard controls: arrow keys nudge selected panel by small increments; shift to nudge faster.
Larger features
Multi-select + group move: hold ctrl and select multiple panels to move them together.
Auto-tiling and layout presets: let users choose tile layouts (2-column, 3-up, floating).
Save/restore workspaces: persist layout to localStorage or backend to restore sessions.
Undo/Redo using reducer + history stack.

6 — Accessibility & keyboard support
Make panels focusable (tabIndex=0), support arrow key nudging and Esc to cancel interactions.
Add ARIA labels on controls and resize handles.
Ensure drag-n-drop functionality has non-pointer fallbacks (keyboard open/close and reflow).

7 — Performance: additional notes
For lists/tables inside panels (ag-grid), enable virtualization (ag-grid does this).
Use will-change: transform on the panel during drag to hint GPU.
Debounce persistence to localStorage (e.g., commit layout on pointerup or every N seconds).
If heavy computations happen (e.g., large collision detection), consider a Web Worker.

8 — Code refactor suggestions (folder & API-level)
Organize into feature folders:
src/
components/
panels/
ResizableDraggablePanel/
index.tsx
styles.module.scss
hooks/useDragMove.ts
MainWorkspace/
index.tsx
hooks/useWorkspaceGrid.ts
GridDropOverlay.tsx
hooks/
usePanelsReducer.ts
useNavDrag.ts
stores/
panelsStore.ts (optional)
utils/
dom.ts
math.ts
Component API improvements
Make ResizableDraggablePanel accept both controlled and uncontrolled patterns:
Controlled: parent passes x,y and onCommitPosition.
Uncontrolled: defaultX, defaultY and component manages its own state (useful for simple cases).
Provide onDragStart, onDrag, onDragEnd callbacks so parent can wire telemetry or analytics.

9 — Persistence, collaboration & sync ideas
Persist layout to localStorage and optionally to backend for multi-device.
Add a version or checksum with layout so migrations are manageable.
For collaborative editing, send commit events via WebSocket on pointerup (not during drag).

10 — Tests & instrumentation
Add unit tests for reducer actions (open, close, move, resize).
Add RTL tests for:
Dragging from nav highlights overlay
Drop opens panel in cell
Panel drag triggers onMove and final commit
Instrument with simple metrics:
Track average time to complete drag for mobile/desktop (to measure UX regressions).
Track layout save frequency.

11 — Prioritized roadmap (small → medium → big)
Quick wins (days)
Add freeform?: boolean prop type and keep freeform passed explicitly from App.
Implement ephemeral transform dragging (RAF) in ResizableDraggablePanel and commit on up.
Add will-change: transform and use translate3d for draggable movement.
Memoize panels with React.memo and stable callbacks.
Medium (1–2 sprints)
Migrate usePanels to useReducer and add persistence to localStorage.
Extract useDragMove and useResizeHandle hooks for reuse.
Add snapping + guide overlay + animated commit.
Add keyboard nudging & z-index manager.
Big (2+ sprints / nice-to-have)
Multi-select & group move.
Layout presets + save/restore profiles.
Collaborative positions over WebSocket.
Replace movement/animation with framer-motion for polished micro-interactions.

12 — Example change I’d implement first (safe PR)
Implement ephemeral transform dragging + commit-on-up in ResizableDraggablePanel.
Change usePanels.movePanel to accept SET_POS commit endpoint; avoid calling move on every pointermove.
Add persistPanels() debounced to localStorage.
